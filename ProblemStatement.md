Educational institutions often struggle to track student performance effectively due to scattered academic and attendance data. This results in missed early warning signs, higher dropout risks, and delayed interventions. To address this, a centralized Student Success Dashboard in Salesforce with TCS Lastmile is proposed. The solution will provide a 360° view of student progress, identify at-risk learners using predictive analytics, and automate communication with faculty, students, and parents—ultimately improving retention, engagement, and overall academic outcomes.
